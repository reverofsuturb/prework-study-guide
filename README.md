# Prework Study Guide

## Description

This is a project detailing information learned while completing the prework portion of the University of Denver Coding Bootcamp. While going through the modules we learned how to navigate and connect to Github, the basic building blocks of HTML, how to change the presentation of a webpage with CSS, use JavaScript to provide interactivity, and much more including using the command line as well as Markdown. This project serves as a representation of the skills acquired through this process.

Each section of this study guide contains notes on HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Git. These are meant to be helpful explanations on the topics, and reminders about commands. While you are on the webpage, be sure to open up the Chrome DevTools (CTRL + SHIFT + I on Windows or COMMAND + OPTION + I on MacOS) where you can see JavaScript in action by taking a look at the console. This will show you which topics there are to study and choose one for you to take a look at.
